Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The NATO Conference
The term software engineering was first coined at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Germany.
This conference addressed the "software crisis", where projects were plagued by delays, budget overruns, and unreliable software.
It emphasized structured programming, documentation, and quality control as essential practices in software development.
2. The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s)
Structured programming introduced a systematic approach to writing software by avoiding goto statements, improving readability, and ensuring better maintainability.
Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming, arguing that well-organized code reduces errors.
Languages like Pascal, C, and Ada emerged, reinforcing modular and logical program development.
3. The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001)
The Agile Manifesto was introduced by software developers in 2001, emphasizing flexibility, iterative development, and customer collaboration over rigid processes.
Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban became popular, replacing traditional waterfall development.
This shift led to faster software releases, continuous improvement, and better adaptation to user needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Produces a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
Design

Architects the system based on requirements.
Includes database design, system architecture, UI/UX, and security considerations.
Produces a Software Design Document (SDD) for developers.
Implementation (Coding)

Developers write code based on design specifications.
Follows best practices, coding standards, and version control.
Uses programming languages and frameworks suited for the project.
Testing

Identifies and fixes defects before deployment.
Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Ensures the software functions as expected.
Deployment

The software is released to production or end-users.
Can be done in phases (e.g., beta testing) or all at once.
Requires proper installation, configuration, and user training.
Maintenance and Support

Fixes bugs, improves performance, and updates features.
Ensures security patches and software scalability.
Adapts software to changing user needs and environments.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process.
Agile is iterative and incremental, allowing continuous improvements.
Flexibility:

Waterfall is rigid; once a phase is completed, going back is difficult.
Agile is highly flexible and adapts to changing requirements.
Phases:

Waterfall has distinct, predefined phases (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance).
Agile follows short development cycles (sprints), delivering small, functional increments.
Customer Involvement:

Waterfall has minimal customer involvement after the initial planning phase.
Agile involves customers throughout development, ensuring continuous feedback.
Risk Handling:

Waterfall has higher risks as issues may only be discovered late in development.
Agile has lower risks since testing and feedback occur early and frequently.
Delivery Time:

Waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the project.
Agile delivers in stages, with working features available earlier.
Best for:

Waterfall is best for projects with stable, well-defined requirements.
Agile is best for projects with evolving requirements and high adaptability.
Appropriate Use Cases
✅ Waterfall is suitable for:

Large-scale government or enterprise projects (e.g., a tax processing system).
